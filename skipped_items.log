Text: A: The principle behind the power to tax is that "taxes are the lifeblood of the government." Their prompt and reliable availability is an essential need. The theory is one of necessity, as the government cannot perform its duty to promote the general welfare and well-being of its citizens without taxes (Bases Conversion and Development Authority v. City Government of Baguio, G.R. No. 192694, February 22, 2023).

However, it also emphasizes that this collection must be done "in accordance with law," because any arbitrariness would undermine the purpose of government. Therefore, a balance must be struck to reconcile the interests of tax authorities and taxpayers to ensure that the ultimate goal of taxation—the promotion of the common good—is achieved (CIR v.

Text: The court determined that while the President has the authority to issue such a ban to protect the domestic industry, the application of this ban to the Freeport Zone is void. The court reasoned that the prohibition's purpose is to protect the "customs territory" (the area outside the Freeport), and applying it to the Freeport would be ultra vires (beyond the scope of authority) and unreasonable. The court concluded that the ban's application should be limited to the secured, fenced-in area of the former Subic Naval Base, consistent with prior rulings that interpret RA 7227's free port privileges as being confined to that specific zone.

Text: The court's analysis of Republic Act No. 7227 (R.A. No. 7227) revealed that it specifically and exclusively granted tax and investment incentives to the Subic Special Economic Zone. The legislative history and deliberations of the law clearly indicated that these privileges were not intended to be automatically extended to other economic zones that might be created later. While the law authorized the President to create other zones, it did not delegate the legislative power to grant tax exemptions to them. Therefore, the President's attempt to extend these same privileges to the John Hay SEZ through Proclamation No. 420 was an invalid modification or expansion of the existing law, making the proclamation ultra vires or beyond the scope of the President's authority.

Text: A: No, a claim for taxes is not considered a debt, demand, contract, or judgment that can be set off. This is a well-settled rule rooted in public policy. The reasoning is that taxes are not a contractual obligation between two parties; rather, they arise from a citizen's duty to the government. Allowing set-offs against tax demands would disrupt the government's financial affairs and ability to fund necessary expenditures, as the collection of taxes would be delayed by potential disputes and lawsuits over the taxpayer's claims (Republic v. Mambulao Lumber Co., G.R. No. L-17725, February 28, 1962).

Text: No. The court reiterated the established rule that taxes cannot be the subject of set-off or compensation against a debt the government owes a taxpayer. This is because the government and the taxpayer are not "mutually creditors and debtors of each other" in the context of taxes. Taxes are not a contract but a duty to the government, and allowing set-offs would cause chaos in government finances. In this specific case, the court also noted that the tax was due to the city government, while the expropriation payment was from the national government, further complicating the claim for compensation.

Text: Yes. The court found that the government's tax claim against the estate and the estate's claim against the government for services rendered can be extinguished through legal compensation. This is because both debts were found to be overdue, demandable, and fully liquidated. Therefore, the debts were extinguished to the concurrent amount by operation of law. The court also ruled that the proper procedure for the government to collect its tax claim from the estate is not through a writ of execution, as this is an improper remedy for claims against a deceased person's estate. Instead, the government should have asked the court to order the administratrix to pay the amount due.

Text: Yes. The court recognized the Pachecos' legal right to decrease their taxes through means the law permits. It found that the "Deed of Exchange" was not a contract of sale because there was no transfer of "actual ownership interests" to a third party. The Pachecos' ownership merely shifted from an individual form to an incorporated one, and they maintained control. Therefore, the court validated the transaction as a legitimate tax avoidance strategy and ruled that the right of first refusal was not violated.

Text: Yes. The Supreme Court reversed the appellate court's decision, siding with the Commissioner. It ruled that the "automatic increase clause" was an integral and determinable part of the original policy at the time of its issuance. The court reasoned that since the future increase was already definite and embedded in the original contract, the "amount insured by the policy" for tax computation purposes should logically include this future increase. To exclude it would be a form of tax avoidance that circumvents the law. Therefore, the deficiency assessment was valid.

The court found that the intermediary sale to Altonaga was a sham, lacking economic substance and serving no purpose other than to create a tax shelter. The court disregarded the intermediary sale and treated the transaction as a single direct sale from CIC to RMI, thus making it subject to the 35% corporate income tax. The court further held that the 10-year prescriptive period for assessing tax in cases of fraud or false returns applied, meaning the assessment was not time-barred. Lastly, the court held Toda's estate liable for the deficiency tax based on a specific provision in the sale of shares contract where Toda held himself personally liable for CIC's tax obligations for the year in question.

Moreover, the court held that the term "exemption" in the Public Telecoms Act does not refer to tax exemptions but rather to exemptions from regulatory or reporting requirements.

A tax exemption is an exception to the rule and must be granted through clear and unequivocal language. The nature of the BOT agreement dictates that BPPC is the actual, direct, and immediate owner and user of the machineries and equipment. NAPOCOR's use is considered contingent and insufficient to meet the "actual, direct, and exclusive" use requirement of the LGC. Since BPPC is the owner-operator and user of the properties, the exemption under Section 234(c) of the LGC does not apply. The privilege granted to NAPOCOR is personal and cannot be extended to a third party like BPPC.

Text: No. The presentation of quarterly ITRs for the succeeding taxable year is not indispensable to prove that excess CWT was not carried over. Section 76 of the NIRC and the implementing rules (Section 2.58.3 of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98) do not explicitly require the presentation of succeeding quarterly ITRs. The annual ITR for the succeeding year can sufficiently prove that prior year's excess credits were not utilized. The court notes that an annual ITR contains the total taxable income, deductions, and tax credits (including "Prior Year's Excess Credits") for all four quarters. If no carry-over was made, this section would be blank. In this specific case, the petitioner's 2004 annual ITR showed no amount in the "Prior Year's Excess Credits" section, which the court found to be sufficient proof.

Text: No. The presentation of quarterly ITRs for the succeeding taxable year is not indispensable to prove that excess CWT was not carried over. Section 76 of the NIRC and the implementing rules (Section 2.58.3 of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98) do not explicitly require the presentation of succeeding quarterly ITRs. The annual ITR for the succeeding year can sufficiently prove that prior year's excess credits were not utilized. The court notes that an annual ITR contains the total taxable income, deductions, and tax credits (including "Prior Year's Excess Credits") for all four quarters. If no carry-over was made, this section would be blank. In this specific case, the petitioner's 2004 annual ITR showed no amount in the "Prior Year's Excess Credits" section, which the court found to be sufficient proof.

Text: No. The court, citing its previous decision in Deutsche Bank, emphasized that the obligation to comply with a tax treaty, which has the force of law, must take precedence over an administrative issuance like RMO No. 1-2000. The court stated that the requirement of a prior application for tax treaty relief becomes "moot" and "illogical" in refund cases where the very basis of the claim is the erroneous or excessive payment that resulted from not availing of the treaty relief in the first place. The court held that the application for tax treaty relief should merely serve to "confirm the entitlement" of the taxpayer to the benefit, not to create that entitlement. In this case, CBK Power's requests for confirmation and subsequent filing of an administrative claim were deemed substantial compliance.

Text: Yes. The court rejects the lower court's assertion that the taxpayer must present Gotesco's BIR Form No. 2307 to prove non-utilization of the tax credit. It states that the information required by this form can be established through other evidence. The court clarifies that the primary purpose of BIR Form No. 2307 is to prove that the tax was withheld, not to prove that it was not utilized. Since PNB had already proven the withholding and remittance through BIR Form No. 1606 and other documents, the presentation of Form No. 2307 would have been "a superfluity." The court finds no basis in law or jurisprudence to require that BIR Form No. 2307 is the only admissible evidence to prove non-utilization. It states that as long as the evidence on record sufficiently proves the non-use, the claim for refund should be granted.

Text: Yes. The court found that CEPHI had fully complied with the requirements of the tax amnesty program under R.A. No. 9480. The court emphasized that a taxpayer's SALN is "presumed true and correct" under the law. The burden of overturning this presumption falls on those who claim there was an underdeclaration of net worth. The court noted that the CIR provided no evidence to prove that CEPHI's net worth was understated by the 30% threshold required by the law to negate the tax amnesty. Without this proof, the presumption stands.

Such an administrative and judicial interpretation would unreasonably reverse the legislative policy of unburdening the taxpayer through exemptions.

Text: The Court held that it applies only to the carry-over option, not to the refund or tax credit certificate option.

This provision, according to the court, supports the idea that a taxpayer can change their option from refund to carry-over. If the refund option were irrevocable, this provision would be illogical.

However, it emphasizes that the number of defects is not the determining factor. The crucial element is the taxpayer's "contributory fault or negligence coupled with estoppel." The taxpayer, ATC, issued eight successive waivers over four years. During this period, ATC corresponded with the tax authorities and allowed the investigation to proceed, leading the BIR to believe that the assessment period had been extended. The taxpayer did not question the validity of the waivers when the Final Letter of Demand (FLD) was issued. Instead, it raised this argument for the first time on appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), after an unfavorable decision on its administrative protest.

Text: The Supreme Court ruled that a special law (the Revised City Charter) is not automatically repealed by a subsequent general law (the Local Tax Code). However, this rule does not apply when the special law addresses a subject in general terms, and the general law addresses that same subject in particular. In this case, the Revised City Charter covers "ordinances" in general, while the Local Tax Code specifically addresses "ordinances levying or imposing taxes, fees or other charges." Therefore, because the Local Tax Code is the more particular law on the specific subject of tax ordinances, and it was enacted later than the City Charter, its provisions prevail.

Text: The Court clarified that uniformity in taxation requires that all subjects or objects of a tax that belong to the same class be taxed at the same rate. The taxing power has the authority to make reasonable and natural classifications for taxation purposes. In this case, the ordinance specifically taxed cinematographs, theaters, vaudeville companies, theatrical shows, and boxing exhibitions as a distinct class of amusement places. The fact that other places of amusement, like racetracks or cockpits, were not taxed by the ordinance did not violate the principle, as these could be considered a different class for tax purposes. The ordinance applied the same tax schedule to all members within the class it defined. The Court also held that the City of Manila's power to tax these businesses was explicitly granted by its charter (Section 2444[m] of the Revised Administrative Code), which authorized the city to tax and regulate "theaters, cinematographs... and other performances and places of amusements." The Court found no conflict between the ordinance and the National Internal Revenue Code, as a city's power to tax for its own purposes can coexist with the national government's power to tax for its own purposes.

Article XIV, Section 4, Paragraph 3 of the 1987 Constitution expressly exempts "all revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes." The Court found that the BIR's claim of "enormous profits" was a misinterpretation of the foundation's gross receipts and cash flow. The evidence showed that after deducting expenses, the foundation's net income was a modest 9.38% of its receipts, and all of its income was used to support its educational mission, with nothing inuring to the benefit of any private individual. The Court reiterated that an institution does not become profit-oriented simply by generating a surplus, as this is necessary for its sustainability.

Text: The FIRB lacked the authority to grant or restore tax exemptions during the period in question. Under Presidential Decree No. 776, the FIRB's power was limited to merely recommending the withdrawal, modification, or suspension of tax exemptions to the President. It did not have the power to actually grant or restore exemptions on its own. Consequently, the FIRB resolutions purporting to restore NAPOCOR's tax privileges for the period from June 11, 1984, to March 10, 1987, were without legal force and effect. The Court affirmed the general principle that the power to tax and to grant tax exemptions is an inherent legislative power, which cannot be delegated to an administrative body unless expressly authorized by the legislature. Since there was no valid exemption in place during the specified period, the law withdrawing the exemption (P.D. No. 1931) remained in effect. The Court also reiterated the principle that tax exemptions are construed strictly against the taxpayer and in favor of the taxing authority.

Text: Whether or not a tax imposed by the City of Manila on retailers for the renewal of their business licenses, in addition to other business taxes already being paid, constitutes a form of illegal or "obnoxious" double taxation.

--- Skipped ---
Reason: quoted_text
Text: No. The Supreme Court has ruled that this does not constitute "obnoxious" or direct double taxation. The taxes were levied on different tax objects or subject matters. The tax under one section of the ordinance was a business tax on wholesalers and retailers, while the tax under another section was a tax on consumers or end-users of the articles sold. Because the taxes were imposed on different subjects, there was no double taxation in the strict sense. The Court clarified that while double taxation is generally frowned upon, it is not entirely illegal unless it violates a constitutional provision. In this case, the impositions did not violate the principle against direct, or "obnoxious," double taxation.

Text: Whether or not a non-resident foreign corporation, a resident of the United States, can invoke the "most favored nation" clause in the RP-US Tax Treaty to claim the concessional tax rate of 10% on royalties, which is granted to German residents under the RP-Germany Tax Treaty, when the RP-US Tax Treaty does not provide for a matching tax credit of 20% as the RP-Germany Tax Treaty does.

--- Skipped ---
Reason: quoted_text
Text: No. The Supreme Court ruled that the non-resident foreign corporation cannot claim the 10% tax rate. The Court held that the phrase "paid under similar circumstances" in the RP-US Tax Treaty refers to the tax-related circumstances, not the payment of the royalty itself. The RP-US Tax Treaty and the RP-Germany Tax Treaty do not provide for similar tax reliefs. Specifically, the RP-Germany Tax Treaty includes a provision for a 20% matching tax credit against German income and corporation tax for the taxes paid to the Philippines on royalties, a provision that is absent from the RP-US Tax Treaty. Because the circumstances of the tax payments are not similar, the "most favored nation" clause cannot be invoked to justify the lower tax rate. The purpose of tax treaties is to prevent double taxation and encourage foreign investment by providing tax incentives, and this goal would be defeated if the tax credit were not also considered. Therefore, the claim for a tax refund was denied.

Text: No. The Supreme Court ruled that the local business tax on contractors must be based on gross receipts, not gross revenue. The Court clarified that the Local Government Code explicitly defines "gross receipts" as money or its equivalent that has been actually or constructively received. This is distinct from "gross revenue," which, under the accrual method of accounting, includes income that has been earned and is billable, but not yet actually or constructively received. The Court held that basing the tax on gross revenue would lead to illegal double taxation, as a business's revenue in a given year would include receipts from a previous year for which tax has already been paid. Therefore, the assessment notices issued by the City of Pasig, which were based on gross revenue, were found to be erroneous and were ordered to be canceled.

Text: Yes. The Supreme Court held that the simultaneous imposition of taxes under Section 21 and other business tax sections (like Sections 14, 15, and 17) of the Revenue Code of Manila does indeed constitute illegal double taxation. The Court reaffirmed its previous rulings, stating that for double taxation to exist, the following conditions must be met: (1) the tax is imposed on the same subject matter (the privilege of doing business in Manila), (2) for the same purpose (to raise city revenues), (3) by the same taxing authority (the City of Manila), (4) within the same jurisdiction and for the same taxing period, and (5) the taxes are of the same kind or character (a local business tax on gross sales or receipts). Since all these elements were present, taxing businesses under both Section 21 and other sections of the same ordinance was found to be a form of direct, "obnoxious" double taxation.

Text: Yes. The Supreme Court held that the simultaneous imposition of taxes under Section 21 and other business tax sections (like Sections 14, 15, and 17) of the Revenue Code of Manila does indeed constitute illegal double taxation. The Court reaffirmed its previous rulings, stating that for double taxation to exist, the following conditions must be met: (1) the tax is imposed on the same subject matter (the privilege of doing business in Manila), (2) for the same purpose (to raise city revenues), (3) by the same taxing authority (the City of Manila), (4) within the same jurisdiction and for the same taxing period, and (5) the taxes are of the same kind or character (a local business tax on gross sales or receipts). Since all these elements were present, taxing businesses under both Section 21 and other sections of the same ordinance was found to be a form of direct, "obnoxious" double taxation. Therefore, the taxes collected under Section 21 were ruled to be illegal and must be refunded.

Text: Whether or not the imposition of a specific tax on both the raw material (stemmed leaf tobacco) and the finished product (cigarettes) constitutes illegal or "obnoxious" double taxation.

--- Skipped ---
Reason: quoted_text
Text: No. The Supreme Court found the contention of double taxation to be without merit. It clarified that for double taxation to be prohibited, the taxes must be imposed on the same property or subject matter, for the same purpose, by the same taxing authority, within the same jurisdiction, during the same taxing period, and be of the same kind or character. In this case, the Court found there was no double taxation in the prohibited sense because the specific tax was imposed on two different articles or products: the stemmed leaf tobacco (raw material) and the cigar or cigarette (finished product). Furthermore, the Court reiterated that double taxation is not constitutionally prohibited in the Philippines, and it is only considered "obnoxious" when a taxpayer is taxed twice by the same jurisdiction for the same purpose, which was not the case here.

Therefore, imposing both a license fee and a tax on the same business or article does not violate the rule against double taxation. The Court also noted that the government is not bound by a previous, incorrect opinion of its officers regarding the law.

Text: No. The Supreme Court ruled that the tax exemption only applied to the manufacturing and sale of the machines themselves, not to the products they produce. The Court reiterated the cardinal rule that tax exemptions are highly disfavored and must be based on a clear and explicit grant in the law. Any claim to an exemption must be justified by language that is "too plain to be mistaken." The tax exemption certificate clearly stated that it was granted for the "manufacture of machines for making cigarette paper, pails, lead washers, nails, rivets, candies, etc." The Court found no ambiguity in this language, which explicitly limited the exemption to the machines.

The law's language must be "too plain to be mistaken" to justify an exemption. The Court affirmed the factual finding that the power barges were owned by FELS, not the NPC. While Section 234(c) of the Local Government Code exempts machinery and equipment "actually, directly and exclusively used by" a government-owned corporation like the NPC, the Court found that FELS, a private entity, was the one operating and managing the barges. Therefore, the exemption for the NPC cannot be extended to FELS, the owner and operator.

Text: Whether or not a general tax law (P.D. No. 231, the Local Tax Code) implicitly repealed a special law (R.A. No. 6020) that granted a tax exemption to a specific corporation, CEPALCO, through the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in its franchise.

--- Skipped ---
Reason: quoted_text
Text: No. The Supreme Court ruled that the general tax law did not repeal the special law, and therefore, CEPALCO's tax exemption remained valid. The Court applied the well-established rule that a special or local statute is not repealed by a later general law unless there is a clear and manifest intent to do so. In this case, P.D. No. 231 contained no express provision repealing CEPALCO's franchise. The Court relied on a long line of jurisprudence affirming that the phrase "in lieu of all taxes" in a corporate franchise acts as a complete exemption from all other taxes, whether national or local, except for the specific tax mentioned in the franchise itself. The Court found that CEPALCO's franchise, which imposed a 3% tax on gross earnings "in lieu of all taxes of whatever authority," was a clear and unequivocal grant of exemption. The Court cited a Local Tax Regulation issued by the Secretary of Finance, which explicitly stated that the franchise tax under the Local Tax Code should not be collected from businesses whose franchises contain the "in-lieu-of-all-taxes" provision. This regulation confirmed the proper interpretation of the law.

Text: Yes. The Court ruled that the LGC, specifically Section 193, is an express and general repeal of all statutes granting exemptions from local taxes, and this provision withdrew the sweeping tax privileges previously enjoyed by the NPC under its charter. The Court explained that this was a deliberate "paradigm shift" intended to strengthen local autonomy by allowing local government units to have a wider tax base and more sources of revenue, consistent with the 1987 Constitution. The Court also clarified that the case of Basco v. PAGCOR was decided before the LGC took effect and is therefore not applicable.

Text: Whether or not a taxpayer with a deficiency in indirect taxes (VAT and excise tax) is disqualified from availing of a tax amnesty under Republic Act No. 9480 on the grounds that it is a "withholding agent with respect to their withholding tax liabilities."

--- Skipped ---
Reason: quoted_text
Text: No. The Supreme Court ruled that the taxpayer (AIA) was not disqualified from availing of the tax amnesty. The Court clarified the fundamental difference between indirect taxes (like VAT and excise tax) and withholding taxes. With indirect taxes, the legal incidence of the tax is on one person (the seller or manufacturer) but the economic burden is shifted to another (the buyer or consumer). With withholding taxes, the incidence and burden of the tax are on the same entity (the taxpayer), and the withholding agent merely acts as a collector for the government. Since AIA was assessed for a deficiency in indirect taxes, it could not be "deemed" a withholding agent, as argued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). The Court emphasized that RA 9480, like all tax amnesty laws, is subject to strict construction. Its exceptions must be clearly and unequivocally stated. The law does not include a specific exception for taxpayers with deficiencies in indirect taxes.

Text: The issue presented in this case is whether the ruling of the Supreme Court in CIR v. Filinvest Development Corporation, G.R. No. 163653, July 19, 2011, may be applied retroactively.

--- Skipped ---
Reason: quoted_text
Text: YES. In Filinvest, the Court held that the instructional letters, as well as the journal and cash vouchers evidencing the advances FDC extended to its affiliates, qualified as loan agreements upon which Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) may be imposed. This interpretation is sanctioned by Section 179 of the NIRC, as amended, as the same clearly requires a DST on debt instruments. The Court's interpretation of "loan agreements" referred to in Section 179 of the NIRC, as pronounced in Filinvest, should be deemed a part of the NIRC as of the date it was passed.

Text: NO, the capital gains tax should not be included. Although the subject foreclosure sale and redemption took place before the effectivity of RR No. 4-99, its provisions may be given retroactive effect in this case, under Section 246 of the NIRC of 1997. In this case, the retroactive application of RR No. 4-99 is more consistent with the policy of aiding the exercise of the right of redemption. As the Court of Tax Appeals concluded in one case, RR No. 4-99 "has curbed the inequity of imposing a capital gains tax even before the expiration of the redemption period [since] there is yet no transfer of title and no profit or gain is realized by the mortgagor at the time of foreclosure sale but only upon expiration of the redemption period." In his commentaries, De Leon expressed the view that while revenue regulations as a general rule have no retroactive effect, if the revocation is due to the fact that the regulation is erroneous or contrary to law, such revocation shall have retroactive operation as to affect past transactions, because a wrong construction of the law cannot give rise to a vested right that can be invoked by a taxpayer.

Text: As a rule, tax exemptions are construed strongly against the claimant. Exemptions must be shown to exist clearly and categorically, and supported by clear legal provisions. In the case at bar, the petitioner's sole refuge is section 13 of Rep. Act No. 6395 exempting from, among others, "all income taxes, franchise taxes and realty taxes to be paid to the National Government, its provinces, cities, municipalities and other government agencies and instrumentalities." However, section 193 of the LGC withdrew, subject to limited exceptions, the sweeping tax privileges previously enjoyed by private and public corporations. Contrary to the contention of petitioner, section 193 of the LGC is an express, albeit general, repeal of all statutes granting tax exemptions from local taxes.

Reason: quoted_text
Text: Not being a local water district, a cooperative registered under R.A. No. 6938, or a non-stock and non-profit hospital or educational institution, petitioner clearly does not belong to the exception. It is therefore incumbent upon the petitioner to point to some provisions of the LGC that expressly grant it exemption from local taxes. But this would be an exercise in futility. Section 137 of the LGC clearly states that the LGUs can impose franchise tax "notwithstanding any exemption granted by any law or other special law." This particular provision of the LGC does not admit any exception.

Text: No. The Court of Tax Appeals does not have jurisdiction. Petitioner V.Y. Domingo Jewellers failed to exhaust administrative remedies. A taxpayer must first file a protest with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) and receive a decision (or a deemed denial due to inaction) before appealing to the CTA. Because the taxpayer in this case, V.Y. Domingo, filed a petition for review with the CTA without first filing an administrative protest, the assessment became final and the CTA lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.

Text: The Final Assessment Notice (FAN) is void. The main issue is the violation of the taxpayer's right to due process, as the CIR issued the FAN before the expiration of the 60-day period granted to the taxpayer to submit supporting documents for their protest against the Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN). The taxpayer filed the protest on April 18, 2013, and had until June 17, 2013, to submit documents. However, the CIR issued the FAN on April 12, 2013, and the taxpayer received it on April 19, 2013. This action by the CIR improperly cut short the taxpayer's legally mandated period to present their case, rendering the FAN null and void.

Text: No. The taxpayer's appeal to the CTA was not filed belatedly. There was no final and appealable decision from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) because the taxpayer's protest on the amended deficiency EWT, which was a component of the Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA), was still pending with the Regional Director. The FDDA could not be considered the final decision while one of its components was still under protest. Therefore, the prescriptive period for appealing to the CTA had not yet begun to run. The court opted not to apply the statutory period to appeal, finding that the taxpayer was merely exhausting administrative remedies, and thus, the case should be remanded to the CTA for a resolution on the merits.
