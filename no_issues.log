Text: A: The doctrine of equitable recoupment states that the recovery or refund of a tax erroneously paid may be allowed to be used as payment for unsettled tax liabilities even if already barred by prescription if both taxes arise from the same transaction in which the overpayment and underpayment is due (US v. Dalm, 491 US 596).

Text: Note: The doctrine of equitable recoupment is not applicable in the Philippines following the rejection by the Supreme Court of the doctrine of equitable recoupment in the case of Collector v. UST (10 Phil 1062), saying that it was not convinced of the wisdom and propriety thereof, and that it may work to tempt both the collecting agency and the taxpayer to delay and neglect their respective pursuits of legal action within the period set by law. This case is followed by Republic v. Mambulao Lumber Co. (6 SCRA 622) where the Supreme Court enunciated the rule that taxes are not subject to set-off or legal compensation (Citytrust Banking Corp. v.

It simply requires that the tax burden be distributed fairly according to the taxpayer's ability to pay.

The legislature has the discretion to choose the means to raise revenue for a public purpose, and the Court will not interfere as long as the law does not violate any constitutional mandates. The purpose of the VAT law was to raise government revenue, which is a legitimate public purpose. Therefore, the Court concluded that the law was valid and did not violate the constitutional principles of uniformity and equitability.

The purpose of the law was to simplify the tax system and generate revenue, and the legislative freeze on the tax base for old brands was a mechanism to manage this transition while ensuring a stable revenue stream. The Court held that all brands that existed on the cutoff date were treated equally, and all new brands were also treated equally among themselves, thus satisfying the requirement of uniformity within each class. The Court concluded that the legislature has the power to classify the subjects of taxation, and as long as the classification is based on a reasonable and not arbitrary basis, it is constitutional.

Text: The Court clarified that MIAA is not a government-owned or controlled corporation (GOCC). It does not have capital stock divided into shares, nor does it have members, meaning it is not a stock or non-stock corporation as defined by the law. Instead, MIAA is a government instrumentality vested with corporate powers to perform governmental functions. The fact that MIAA collects fees for the use of the airport does not change its character as a property for public use. MIAA merely holds the title to these properties in trust for the Republic of the Philippines. Taxing these properties would amount to the government taxing itself, which serves no public advantage.

Text: No. The Supreme Court ruled that the grant of tax exemptions and other privileges to the John Hay SEZ by presidential proclamation was void for being unconstitutional. The power to grant tax exemptions is a legislative function that belongs to Congress, and any such law must have the concurrence of a majority of all its members. Tax exemptions are to be strictly construed against the taxpayer and cannot be granted by mere implication. They must be expressly and unequivocally provided for in a statute. R.A. No. 7227, the law that created the Subic SEZ, specifically limited its incentives to that zone. Lastly, a presidential proclamation cannot amend or expand the provisions of a statute. The incentives under R.A. No. 7227 were exclusive to the Subic SEZ, and the President could not, through a proclamation, extend them to the John Hay SEZ without a new law from Congress.

Text: Whether or not an enterprise registered with the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) is the proper party to claim a tax refund or credit for excise taxes on petroleum products that were purchased from a supplier who, as the statutory taxpayer, passed on the tax burden to the EPZA-registered enterprise.

--- No Issues ---
Text: Yes. The Supreme Court ruled that the EPZA-registered enterprise (PASAR) is the proper party to claim the tax refund or credit. The Court distinguished between exemptions from direct and indirect taxes. If a law grants an exemption from both, the entity that bears the economic burden of the tax can claim the refund, even if it is not the statutory taxpayer. Section 17 of P.D. No. 66, the EPZA law, expressly states that supplies, whether used directly or indirectly, are not subject to internal revenue laws and regulations. The Court had previously interpreted this provision to cover both customs duties and internal revenue taxes, including excise taxes. Because the law grants an exemption from both direct and indirect taxes, and the excise taxes were passed on to PASAR, the latter, as the entity that bore the economic burden, has the legal personality to file the claim for a tax refund. The Court referenced prior cases, such as Commissioner of Customs v. Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corp. and Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corporation v.

Text: Whether or not an enterprise registered with the Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) is the proper party to claim a tax refund or credit for excise taxes on petroleum products that were purchased from a supplier who, as the statutory taxpayer, passed on the tax burden to the EPZA-registered enterprise.

--- No Issues ---
Text: Yes. The Supreme Court ruled that the EPZA-registered enterprise (PASAR) is the proper party to claim the tax refund or credit. The Court distinguished between exemptions from direct and indirect taxes. If a law grants an exemption from both, the entity that bears the economic burden of the tax can claim the refund, even if it is not the statutory taxpayer. Section 17 of P.D. No. 66, the EPZA law, expressly states that supplies, whether used directly or indirectly, are not subject to internal revenue laws and regulations. The Court had previously interpreted this provision to cover both customs duties and internal revenue taxes, including excise taxes. Because the law grants an exemption from both direct and indirect taxes, and the excise taxes were passed on to PASAR, the latter, as the entity that bore the economic burden, has the legal personality to file the claim for a tax refund. The Court referenced prior cases, such as Commissioner of Customs v. Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corp. and Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, which established that EPZA-registered enterprises are exempt from such taxes and have the right to seek a refund for them.

Text: Whether or not the tax exemption privileges of the National Power Corporation (NPC) under its charter were withdrawn by the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991, making it liable for local business taxes.

--- No Issues ---
Text: Yes. The Supreme Court ruled that the tax exemption privileges of the NPC under its charter were indeed withdrawn by the LGC. The Court referenced its prior ruling in National Power Corporation v. City of Cabanatuan, which established that Section 193 of the LGC is an express and general repeal of all statutes granting exemptions from local taxes. This provision effectively withdrew the blanket tax privileges previously enjoyed by government instrumentalities, including the NPC. The Court explained that a primary goal of the LGC is to strengthen local autonomy by giving local government units (LGUs) greater power to generate their own sources of revenue. This paradigm shift requires that even government instrumentalities contribute to local taxes.

--- No Issues ---
Text: The Court clarified that while PAL's franchise required a special law to expressly modify or repeal it, R.A. No. 7716 met this requirement. The new law did not amend the franchise by mere implication; it specifically amended Section 103 of the National Internal Revenue Code to explicitly list P.D. No. 1590 as one of the special laws whose tax exemptions were no longer applicable to the VAT.

While Section 133(o) of the LGC generally exempts the National Government and its instrumentalities from local taxes, this provision is qualified by more specific sections concerning real property tax. Sections 232 and 234 of the LGC specifically authorize local governments to levy real property taxes and withdraw all previous exemptions from such taxes, including those granted to government-owned corporations. The Court pointed to the last paragraph of Section 234 and Section 193 of the LGC, which explicitly withdraw tax exemptions previously granted to natural and juridical persons, including government-owned or controlled corporations.

Text: Whether or not a claim for a tax refund, even if the tax was erroneously collected from a tax-exempt entity, is barred by prescription if the claim is not filed within the two-year period mandated by the Tax Code.

--- No Issues ---
Text: Yes. The Supreme Court ruled that the claim for a tax refund was barred by prescription. The Court emphasized that Section 229 of the Tax Code provides a mandatory two-year prescriptive period for filing a suit or proceeding for the recovery of erroneously or illegally collected national internal revenue taxes. This period runs from the date of tax payment, regardless of any supervening cause, such as the taxpayer's discovery of the error or the issuance of a confirmatory ruling from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). 

--- No Issues ---
Text: The Court rejected the argument that the six-year prescriptive period for quasi-contracts under the Civil Code (specifically, solutio indebiti) should apply. The Court explained that the elements of solutio indebiti were not present, as there was a binding legal relationship between the taxpayer (MERALCO as a withholding agent) and the government. Furthermore, the Tax Code, as a special law, explicitly provides the specific prescriptive period for tax refunds, which takes precedence over the general provisions of the Civil Code.

Text: A: Tax Amnesty is an immunity from all criminal and civil obligations arising from non-payment of taxes. It is a general pardon given to all taxpayers. It partakes of an absolute waiver by the government of its right to collect what is due and to give tax evaders who wish to relent a chance to start with a clean slate. It applies only to past tax periods, hence of retroactive application.

--- No Issues ---
Text: A: The doctrine of operative fact is incorporated in Section 246 of the Tax Code, which provides that “any revocation, modification, or reversal of any of the rules and regulations promulgated in accordance with the preceding Sections or any of the rulings or circulars promulgated by the Commissioner shall not be given retroactive application if the revocation, modification, or reversal will be prejudicial to the taxpayers.

--- No Issues ---
Text: However, the rule also has exceptions, to wit:

--- No Issues ---
Text:  Where the taxpayer deliberately misstates or omits material facts from his return or any document required of him by the Bureau of Internal Revenue;

--- No Issues ---
Text: Where the taxpayer acted in bad faith.” (Sec. 246, NIRC)

Text: Hence, under Section 246, taxpayers may rely upon a rule or ruling issued by the Commissioner from the time the rule or ruling is issued up to its reversal by the Commissioner or this Court. The reversal is not given retroactive effect. This, in essence, is the doctrine of operative fact.

Text: The issue presented before the Supreme Court in this case is whether the liberal application of technicalities in tax refund cases is applicable regarding the amended return filed by Acosta.

--- No Issues ---
Text: NO. The Supreme Court was unable to agree on respondent’s submission invoking the liberal application of technicalities in tax refund cases. 

--- No Issues ---
Text: Entrenched in our jurisprudence is the principle that tax refunds are in the nature of tax exemptions which are construed strictissimi juris against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the government. As tax refunds involve a return of revenue from the government, the claimant must show indubitably the specific provision of law from which her right arises; it cannot be allowed to exist upon a mere vague implication or inference nor can it be extended beyond the ordinary and reasonable intendment of the language actually used by the legislature in granting the refund. To repeat, strict compliance with the conditions imposed for the return of revenue collected is a doctrine consistently applied in this jurisdiction.

--- No Issues ---
Text: Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot agree that the amended return filed by respondent constitutes the written claim for refund required by the old Tax Code, the law prevailing at that time. Neither can we apply the liberal interpretation of the law based on our pronouncement in the case of BPI-Family Savings Bank, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, as the taxpayer therein filed a written claim for refund aside from presenting other evidence to prove its claim, unlike this case before us.

Even if the Court were to agree, therefore, to accord precipitate credulity to the CIR's bare assertion that FDC had deducted substantial interest expense from its gross income, there would still be no factual basis for the imputation of theoretical interests on the subject advances and assess deficiency income taxes thereon. More so, when it is borne in mind that, pursuant to Article 1956 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, no interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing. Considering that taxes, being burdens, are not to be presumed beyond what the applicable statute expressly and clearly declares, the rule is likewise settled that tax statutes must be construed strictly against the government and liberally in favor of the taxpayer. 

--- No Issues ---
Text: Accordingly, the general rule of requiring adherence to the letter in construing statutes applies with peculiar strictness to tax laws and the provisions of a taxing act are not to be extended by implication. While it is true that taxes are the lifeblood of the government, it has been held that their assessment and collection should be in accordance with law as any arbitrariness will negate the very reason for government itself.

It is consequently clear that a judicial interpretation becomes a part of the law as of the date that law was originally passed, subject only to the qualification that when a doctrine of this Court is overruled and a different view is adopted, and more so when there is a reversal thereof, the new doctrine should be applied prospectively and should not apply to parties who relied on the old doctrine and acted in good faith. To hold otherwise would be to deprive the law of its quality of fairness and justice then, if there is no recognition of what had transpired prior to such adjudication.

Text: The issue presented in this case was whether private respondent Burroughs Limited is legally entitled to a refund of the amount of P172,058.90.

--- No Issues ---
Text: The Supreme Court ruled in the affirmative. Petitioner CIR contends that respondent is no longer entitled to a refund because Memorandum Circular No. 8-82 dated March 17, 1982 had revoked and/or repealed the BIR ruling of January 21, 1980. Petitioner’s contention is without merit as what is applicable in the case at bar is still the Revenue Ruling of January 21, 1980 because private respondent Burroughs Limited paid the branch profit remittance tax in question on March 14, 1979. Memorandum Circular No. 8-82 dated March 17, 1982 cannot be given retroactive effect in the light of Section 327 (Now Section 246) of the NIRC. 

--- No Issues ---
Text: The prejudice that would result to private respondent Burroughs Limited by a retroactive application of Memorandum Circular No. 8-82 is beyond question for it would be deprived of the substantial amount of P172,058.90. And, insofar as the enumerated exceptions are concerned, admittedly, Burroughs Limited does not fall under any of them.

Text: The issue presented in this case was whether private respondent Burroughs Limited is legally entitled to a refund of the amount of P172,058.90.

--- No Issues ---
Text: The Supreme Court ruled in the affirmative. Petitioner CIR contends that respondent is no longer entitled to a refund because Memorandum Circular No. 8-82 dated March 17, 1982 had revoked and/or repealed the BIR ruling of January 21, 1980. Petitioner’s contention is without merit as what is applicable in the case at bar is still the Revenue Ruling of January 21, 1980 because private respondent Burroughs Limited paid the branch profit remittance tax in question on March 14, 1979. Memorandum Circular No. 8-82 dated March 17, 1982 cannot be given retroactive effect in the light of Section 327 (Now Section 246) of the NIRC. 

--- No Issues ---
Text: The prejudice that would result to private respondent Burroughs Limited by a retroactive application of Memorandum Circular No. 8-82 is beyond question for it would be deprived of the substantial amount of P172,058.90. And, insofar as the enumerated exceptions are concerned, admittedly, Burroughs Limited does not fall under any of them.

Text: The issue presented before the Supreme Court in this case was whether the disputed classification freeze provision is violative of the equal protection and uniformity of taxation clauses because older tobacco brands are taxed based on their 1996 net retail prices while new brands are taxed based on their present-day net retail prices.

--- No Issues ---
Text: No, the classification is not violative of the equal protection and uniformity of taxation clauses. 

--- No Issues ---
Text: The classification is considered valid and reasonable provided that: (1) it rests on substantial distinctions; (2) it is germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it applies, all things being equal, to both present and future conditions; and (4) it applies equally to all those belonging to the same class.

--- No Issues ---
Text: In this case, the first, third and fourth requisites are satisfied. The classification freeze provision was inserted in the law for reasons of practicality and expediency and could hardly be considered arbitrary, or motivated by a hostile or oppressive attitude to unduly favor older brands over newer brands. 

--- No Issues ---
Text: All in all, the classification freeze provision addressed Congress’s administrative concerns in the simplification of tax administration of sin products, elimination of potential areas for abuse and corruption in tax collection, buoyant and stable revenue generation, and ease of projection of revenues. Consequently, there can be no denial of the equal protection of the laws since the rational-basis test is amply satisfied.

Text: In this case, the Supreme Court was tasked to resolve whether petitioner Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA), created by virtue of R.A. No. 6958, is entitled to a tax exemption.

--- No Issues ---
Text: The Supreme Court ruled in the negative. There can be no question that under Section 14 of R.A. No. 6958 the petitioner is exempt from the payment of realty taxes imposed by the National Government or any of its political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. Nevertheless, since taxation is the rule and exemption therefrom the exception, the exemption may thus be withdrawn at the pleasure of the taxing authority. The only exception to this rule is where the exemption was granted to private parties based on material consideration of a mutual nature, which then becomes contractual and is thus covered by the non-impairment claim of the Constitution.

--- No Issues ---
Text: Since the last paragraph of Section 234 unequivocally withdrew, upon the effectivity of the LGC, exemptions from payment of real property taxes granted to natural or juridical persons, including government-owned or controlled corporations, except as provided in the said section, and the petitioner is, undoubtedly, a government-owned corporation, it necessarily follows that its exemption from such tax granted it in Section 14 of its Charter, R.A. No. 6958, has been withdrawn. Any claim to the contrary can only be justified if the petitioner can seek refuge under any of the exceptions provided in Section 234, but not under Section 133, as it now asserts, since, as shown above, the said section is qualified by Sections 232 and 234.

Text: NO, insurance companies cannot be classified as lending investors subject to the 3% percentage tax. 

--- No Issues ---
Text: Petitioner alleges that the definition of lending investors under CA 466 is broad enough to encompass insurance companies. Petitioner insists that because of Section 194(u), the two principal activities of the insurance business, namely, underwriting and investment, are separately taxable. Petitioner also contends that the refund granted to respondents is in the nature of a tax exemption, and cannot be allowed unless granted explicitly and categorically.

--- No Issues ---
Text: The rule that tax exemptions should be construed strictly against the taxpayer presupposes that the taxpayer is clearly subject to the tax being levied against him. Unless a statute imposes a tax clearly, expressly and unambiguously, what applies is the equally well-settled rule that the imposition of a tax cannot be presumed. Where there is doubt, tax laws must be construed strictly against the government and in favor of the taxpayer. This is because taxes are burdens on the taxpayer, and should not be unduly imposed or presumed beyond what the statutes expressly and clearly import.

--- No Issues ---
Text: In this case, the definition in Section 194(u) of CA 466 is not broad enough to include the business of insurance companies. The Insurance Code of 1978 is very clear on what constitutes an insurance company.  … More specifically, respondents fall under the category of insurance corporations as defined in Section 185 of the Insurance Code.

Where payment was made, the taxpayer may maintain an action in court questioning the validity and correctness of the assessment (Section 195, LGC) and at the same time seeking a refund of the taxes.
